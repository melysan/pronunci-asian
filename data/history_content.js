        Why? Well, back in the feudal times, kings required people to change their 
        last names to avoid punishment and as a sign of submission. Families also changed 
        their name to gain favours from the current dynastry. 
        The Nguyễn dynasty was the last dynasty so no new kings forced other families 
        to change their names from Nguyễn.`
