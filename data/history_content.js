         ID checks, and insurance claims due to their names having characters that were often 
         unrecognizable by digital devices. Many people have thus changed their names for the sake
          of convenience, which in turn is pushing certain characters to the brink of dying out.`

        articletext:`About 39 percent of Vietnamese people share the last name, Nguyễn. 
        The reason why is because back in the feudal times, kings required people to change their 
        last names to avoid punishment and as a sign of submission. Families also changed 
        their name to gain favours from the current dynasty. 
        The Nguyễn dynasty was the last dynasty so no new kings forced other families 
        to change their names from Nguyễn.`

        Most Vietnamese have one middle name, but it is quite possible 
        to have two or more, or even no middle names at all. It might be 
        because of their parents' personal preference, or a family's naming tradition.
        If someone has a middle name, usually they are referred to as their first name only unless
        there are others who share the same first name. In this case, they will be referred to their middle and first name.

        articletext:`If you have some experience with Japanese, you may have noticed that lots of Japanese titles start with “o.”
         An “o” at the beginning of a Japanese title is usually an honorific prefix.
        Removing the “o” makes the title more colloquial, and in some cases, rude.
        For example, the word for mother, with Japanese honorifics, is oka-san. 
        Without the prefix, it becomes ka-san, which is more like “mom” than “mother.”
        Keep this in mind as you learn about Japanese honorific suffixes.`
